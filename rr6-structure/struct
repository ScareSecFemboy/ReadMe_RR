RR6's structure is pretty big, given the amount of files, commands, scripts, servers, files, config etc this needs kinda a write down of whats all happening 

Files are the following

Config      -> API keys and config files 
install     -> Install RR6, and make file
modules     -> Broken down into the instalable perl modules, the go modules, the go files, ruby files, and other dependant modules RR6 may use 
scripts     -> Scripts are all of the possible scripts and weapons rr6 will run, which are broken down into category like wifi, exploits, bluetooth, etc etc
text        -> All banners, help files, module files, pod files etc 
server      -> The offical RR6 documentation server

This structure over time will keep growing bigger and bigger meaning it will be harder to maintain, unless you are the dev of RR6 or a developer and helper of the RR6 development and 
security team, you may delete this file.
