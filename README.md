# What is the red rabbit project 

The red rabbit project is an offensive security framework that is like no other, a framework that aims to touch on all fields of cyber security known to the developers and security team, Scare Security has finally brought a whole new relm of possibilities and easy setups for hackers across the world.

# Why choose us

This project is one of the more rare cyber security tools out there, most frameworks you see today like wifite, or even smaller frameworks like brute forcing or even basic tool frameworks just arent enough, sometimes as a developer i wondered why these programs got so much stars and downloads in a small amount of time which led me to make something diffent. While most frameworks again like wifite are frameworks that just simply automate other peoples tools like the aircrack suite since noone really can recreate such legendary tool kits or find ways to advance them. This framework is not like your average framework where it automates someone elses tool/toolkit and calls it a day. Here are some reasons why this project should be used as a framework
