# What is the red rabbit project 

The red rabbit project is an offensive security framework that is like no other, a framework that aims to touch on all fields of cyber security known to the developers and security team, Scare Security has finally brought a whole new relm of possibilities and easy setups for hackers across the world.

# Why choose us

This project is one of the more rare cyber security tools out there, most frameworks you see today like wifite, or even smaller frameworks like brute forcing or even basic tool frameworks just arent enough, sometimes as a developer i wondered why these programs got so much stars and downloads in a small amount of time which led me to make something diffent. While most frameworks again like wifite are frameworks that just simply automate other peoples tools like the aircrack suite since noone really can recreate such legendary tool kits or find ways to advance them. This framework is not like your average framework where it automates someone elses tool/toolkit and calls it a day. Here are some reasons why this project should be used as a framework 

> Lightweight: This program is built using the go programming language with limited third party libraries, while using perl and ruby everything is either pre installed in any average linux system or is kept in a file rather than installed in the root directory so it can be deleted later 

> User Control: Most frameworks have 1-5 tools or maybe are automation scripts that will automate certian processes and toolkits ( As wifite does which makes it a good framework ), however red rabbit allows the user to have control over the output such as using flags like --reso which you can specify if your screen is veritcle or landscape which will control how the output is formatted, and also gives the user complete control over the options in the menu in commands like parse which is a parser to dump certian keys or information in files like Pcap, GIF, PNG etc files 

> Open Source: Alot of the projects the team and i scout online are mostly compiled, non open source, or encoded which can often give the illusion that the tool is faked and does not work or the owner has something to hide, red rabbit leaves its code completely open source for security researchers and future developers to look in to 

> Large selection of utilities: the Red Rabbit project has many utilities that like to give the user multiple options on how the script should run the utility

# What does the red rabbit project have to offer 

This project has alot to offer especially when it comes to offensive cyber security, here are some examples 

> Stegonography: In terms of stegonography you can inject the following file formats with red rabbit 

| Command name  | Description                                                   | 
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |  
|  inject gif   | Allows the user to inject GIF images with custom payloads     |
|  inject bmp   | Allows the user to inject BMP images with custom payloads     |
|  inject jpg   | Allows the user to inject JPG images with custom payloads     |
|  inject png   | Allows the user to inject PNG images at chunks with payloads  | 
|  inject webp  | Allows the user to inject WEBP images with custom payloads    |
|  inject zip   | Allows the user to inject JPG images with an archive file     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------- |
