This file is for maintainers of a software distribution which would like
to include Libwhisker.  I thought I'd document a few things in order to
make your life easier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If there are any changes which would make your life as an distribution
package maintainer easier, feel free to let me know.  I will try to
accomodate as best I can.  I appreciate your time and effort in helping
distribute libwhisker2, so I would like to make the process as painless
as possible for you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, here's a brief recommended description of Libwhisker for use.  If
it's too long, then just use the first two sentences.

Libwhisker is a Perl library useful for HTTP testing scripts.  It
contains a pure-Perl implementation of functionality found in the LWP,
URI, Digest::MD5, Digest::MD4, Data::Dumper, Authen::NTLM, HTML::Parser,
HTML::FormParser, CGI::Upload, MIME::Base64, and GetOpt::Std modules.
Libwhisker is designed to be portable (a single perl file), fast (general
benchmarks show libwhisker is faster than LWP), and flexible (great care
was taken to ensure the library does exactly what you want to do, even
if it means breaking the protocol).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to make sure the LW2.pm is installed in the system perl module
directory. I very, very, *very* STRONGLY suggest that you depreciate any
Libwhisker 1.x packages and instead install the LW.pm included in the
Libwhisker 2.x compat/ directory (this can be done with the 'install_lw1'
Makefile.pl command).  The compatible-LW.pm provides the normal Libwhisker
1.x functionality using the Libwhisker 2.x library.  This allows both 
Libwhisker 1.x and 2.x support to be contained in a single Libwhisker 
package (preferred).

Documentation for LW2 is embedded inside the final LW2.pm (unless you build
with the 'nopod' option).  You should use pod2man and store the resulting
output amongst the local collection of Perl module manpages.  The 
Makefile.pl will automatically install the POD page (assuming you haven't
used the 'nopod' option) when you run the 'install' command.

The files in docs/ and scripts/ are for programming references, and as
such, should not be installed with a normal package.  If you truly do want
to include supporting files, then I recommend only the following:

	docs/crawler.txt
	docs/whisker_hash.txt
	docs/logo-builton.gif
	docs/logo-name.gif
	docs/logo-plain.gif
	scripts/api_demo.pl
	scripts/crawl_demo.pl
	scripts/simple_demo.pl
