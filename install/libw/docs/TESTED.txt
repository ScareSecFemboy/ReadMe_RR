The following platforms have been tested and found to be working
as expected (with exceptions noted below).  All platforms were
tested for both native HTTP as well as SSL support through
Net::SSL and Net::SSLeay.  Tests include ability to make non-blocking
connections with appropriate timeouts and SSL keep-alive support via
Net::SSLeay.  Unless otherwise indicated, the platform supports both
SSL libraries and all functionality as expected.  Note that exceptions
are specific to the Perl version and platform indicated.
